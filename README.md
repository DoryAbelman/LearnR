# LearnR
Attached in this repository are some Rscripts I prepared for students in the University of Toronto's Stats 221 course: The Practice of Statistics 2 (STA221), in winter 2022. These are a series of scripts students can follow to learn the ins and outs of R, from just opening Rstudio for the first time to advanced simple and multiple linear regression. Each script is designed to take approximately 1h to complete and to be reviewed live with students. 

I received direct support in preparing these these scripts from Jessie Yeung and Rose Garrett at the University of Toronto in the form of feedback, templates, and brainstorming. I also received indirect support through gaining inspiration from tutorial code prepared for lectures hosted by Katherine Daignault at the University of Toronto. 

Each week's code builds upon the last week's code with some review, followed by new components. There are also several links throughout the documents that connect learners to outside sources that help to explain concepts further. 

I hope this repository will be useful for those intersted in getting started with regression in R. I hope to continue updating it over time with new scripts that explore concepts further. I am happy to take any feedback on this repository through comments on the repository itself or direct message on GitHub. Thank you for visiting this repository page.
